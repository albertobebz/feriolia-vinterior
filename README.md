#### Steps to check the project

I did it using JS firts and then Ruby, so there are 2 directories, one for each approach, the visual result on terminal is slighty different tho.

#### for JS
checkout test-js (NodeJS needs to be installed)
run  `node vinterior-js-test.js`

#### for Ruby
checkout test-ruby
run `ruby checkout_test.rb`
